\noindent It is well established that organizational practices matter for workforce composition and productivity, but the mechanisms behind these effects are less well understood. In this paper, we explore how structured personnel management practices relate to actual HR outcomes and productivity. We match structured management practices data from the World Management Survey to AKM estimates of worker and firm fixed effects and industrial survey data from ten years of Brazilian  administrative data. We have four key findings: first, consistent with the literature, we find that worker and manager fixed effects, as well as structured management, are positively correlated with firm productivity. Second, we find evidence of positive recruitment: better managed firms hire a larger share of their new recruits --- managers and production workers --- from the top of the distribution of worker fixed effects. Third, we find suggestive evidence of better worker matching and retention from lower separation rates. Fourth, we decompose the variation of personnel management practices and find that promotion and retention practices show the strongest correlation with manager fixed effects.
