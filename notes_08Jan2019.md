![pic of underwear hanger](underwear_hanger.png)
* Introduction
* Terminology
  * We *aren't* going to talk about "good" and "bad" firms, lest we incur wrath of Brynjolfsson (and Scur)
  * We could use "structured" vs. "unstructured." Daniela has a good paragraph explaining this.
* Conceptual Underwear Hanger
* Order, Content, and Format of Exhibits
  * Table I
    * Discuss firm effect / attenuation of prod worker effect
  * Hiring Figure vs. Stayer figure
  * Table II
    * People vs Non-people (instead of people vs operations)
    * Put people first
    * Check Panel B controls for operations management
  * Check all figures to make sure terminology is consistent, etc.
* Potential referee concerns
  * Re-do figure 2 using sales shares
  * Split sample
  * Footnote about AKM correlation between \theta and \psi (Nick's concern)
  * Match effects thingy

# Other stuff that we would like to do 

# Tasks

* Create stock figures separately for managers and non-managers
* Create Lorenz curve figures for managers and non-managers
* Revise code that pulls and assembles figures
* Edit figure and table notes to describe "quality" and "structured" terminology
