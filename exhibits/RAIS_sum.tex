    \footnotesize{Notes: Summary statistics of the RAIS data used to estimate the AKM decomposition. 
    The data are a worker-year panel constructed from the raw RAIS job-year files. We assign workers to the job with highest reported earnings over the year.
    We also drop all worker-year observations where the number of reported jobs is greater than 2.
    We drop jobs with fewer than 30 contracted hours per week, jobs in the public sector, jobs in plants with fewer than 5 workers, and jobs with missing data
    on tenure or earnings. The final number of observations is $N = 353,141,951$.}
