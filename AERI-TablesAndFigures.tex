\footnotesize{\textbf{Notes:} Results of linear regressions projecting plant-level averages of worker quality (estimated AKM worker effects) onto measures of management. 
In columns (1)--(4), the dependent variable is the average quality of production workers.
In columns (5)--(8), the dependent variable is the average quality of managers.
All models control for the log of employment, the year of observation (either 2008 or 2013), two-digit industry codes, the share of unionized workers, firm age, and whether the firm is multinational. 
In columns (1)--(3) and (5)--(7), the regressors of interest are the standardized measures of operations management and people management. In columns (4) and (8), the regressors of interest are the six subcomponents of the people-management measure. These measure the extent of structured management practices with respect to: (i) instilling a talent mindset; (ii) building a high-performance culture; (iii) making room for talent; (iv) developing talent; (v) creating a distinctive employee value proposition; (vi) retaining talent. For details of these different measures, see \citet{bloom_qje2007} and \citet{wms_jeea}.}
