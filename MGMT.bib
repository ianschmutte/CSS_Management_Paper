 abstract = {We consider the role that firm attributes play in accounting for the divergence in the careers of women and men, with the onset of parenthood. We exploit a matched employer-employee data set from Sweden that provides a rich set of firm and worker attributes. We index firms by their “family friendliness” and analyze the effect of firm family friendliness on the career gap between mothers and fathers. We find that women disproportionately sort into family friendly firms after first birth and that the wage penalty to motherhood is diminished by being assigned to a more family friendly firm or job. We also find that working in a more family friendly firm or job diminishes the parenthood penalty to labor earnings and makes it easier for mothers to work more hours. At the same time, the smaller wage and income penalties to parents from working in family friendly firms and jobs come at the expense of their occupational progression, especially among mothers, impeding their ability to climb career ladders. Finally, we find that family friendly jobs are more easily substitutable for one another. This latter finding suggests that family friendly firms are able to accommodate the family responsibilities of their workers while still managing to keep their costs low. Our findings also suggest that paid parental leave with job protection – which are features of the Swedish context – may not be sufficient to achieve the balancing of career and family responsibilities, but that the way firms and jobs are structured can play a crucial role in facilitating this balance.},

First, we propose two new residual diagnostic tests of the assumption that mobility is exogenous to unmodeled determinants of earnings. Both tests reject exogenous mobility. We relax the exogenous mobility assumptions by modeling the evolution of the matched data as an evolving bipartite graph using a Bayesian latent class framework. Our results suggest that endogenous mobility biases estimated firm effects toward zero. To assess validity, we match our estimates of the wage components to out-of-sample estimates of revenue per worker. The corrected estimates attribute much more of the variation in revenue per worker to variation in match quality and worker quality than the uncorrected estimates.},

 abstract = {Recent research suggests that much of the cross-firm variation in measured productivity is due to differences in use of advanced management practices. Many of these practices – including monitoring, goal setting, and the use of incentives – are mediated through employee decision-making and effort. To the extent that these practices are complementary with workers’ skills, better-managed firms will tend to recruit higher-ability workers and adopt pay practices to retain these employees. We use a unique data set that combines detailed survey data on the management practices of German manufacturing firms with longitudinal earnings records for their employees to study the relationship between productivity, management, worker ability, and pay.  As documented by Bloom and Van Reenen (2007) there is a strong partial correlation between management practice scores and firm-level productivity in Germany. In our preferred TFP estimates only a small fraction of this correlation is explained by the higher human capital of the average employee at better-managed firms. A larger share (about 13%) is attributable to the human capital of the highest-paid workers, a group we interpret as representing the managers of the firm.  And a similar amount is mediated through the pay premiums offered by better-managed firms. Looking at employee inflows and outflows, we confirm that better-managed firms systematically recruit and retain workers with higher average human capital.  Overall, we conclude that workforce selection and positive pay premiums explain just under 30% of the measured impact of management practices on productivity in German manufacturing.},

Studies of wage determination with worker and firm fixed effects typically find that firm-specific premiums explain 20\% of overall wage variation. To interpret these findings, we develop a model of wage setting in which workers have idiosyncratic tastes for different workplaces. Simple versions of this model can rationalize standard fixed effects specifications and also match the typical rent-sharing elasticities in the literature. }

For U.S. manufacturing plants we find this relationship to be more nuanced than prior research on \{UK\} plants. Most management techniques are shown to have beneficial spillovers to energy efficiency, but an emphasis on generic targets, conditional on other management practices, results in spillovers that increase energy intensity. Our specification controls for industry specific effects at a detailed 6-digit \{NAICS\} level and finds the relationship between management and energy use to be strongest for firms in energy intensive industries. We interpret the empirical result that generic management practices do not necessarily spillover to improved energy performance as evidence of an “energy management gap.” "

abstract = {We study a longitudinal sample of over one million French workers from more than five hundred thousand employing firms. We decompose real total annual compensation per worker into components related to observable employee characteristics, personal heterogeneity, firm heterogeneity, and residual variation. Except for the residual, all components may be correlated in an arbitrary fashion. At the level of the individual, we find that person effects, especially those not related to observables like education, are a very important source of wage variation in France. Firm effects, while important, are not as important as person effects. At the level of firms, we find that enterprises that hire high-wage workers are more productive but not more profitable. They are also more capital and high-skilled employee intensive. Enterprises that pay higher wages, controlling for person effects, are more productive and more profitable. They are also more capital intensive but are not more high-skilled labor intensive. We find that person effects explain about 90\% of inter-industry wage differentials and about 75\% of the firm-size wage effect while firm effects explain relatively little of either differential.},

On average, we find that in manufacturing American, Japanese, and German firms are the best managed. Firms in developing countries, such as Brazil, China and India tend to be poorly managed. American retail firms and hospitals are also well managed by international standards, although American schools are worse managed than those in several other developed countries. We also find substantial variation in management practices across organizations in every country and every sector, mirroring the heterogeneity in the spread of performance in these sectors. One factor linked to this variation is ownership. Government, family, and founder owned firms are usually poorly managed, while multinational, dispersed shareholder and private-equity owned firms are typically well managed. Stronger product market competition and higher worker skills are associated with better management practices. Less regulated labor markets are associated with improvements in incentive management practices such as performance based promotion.},

Faculty who end up moving to better or comparable positions were penalized as severely for seniority while they were in our sample as faculty who stay. These results are incompatible with the raiding hypothesis. Faculty from top 10 programs are also punished for seniority but to a lesser degree than other faculty, which could reflect reduced monopsony power against such faculty if they are more marketable. All results persist when we control for prospective publications and allow lower returns for older publications.

abstract = {We use a comprehensive dataset of French manufacturing \ldots rms to study their internal orga- nization. We \ldots rst divide the employees of each \ldots rm into ‘layers’using occupational categories. Layers are hierarchical in that the typical worker in a higher layer earns more, and the typical \ldots rm occupies less of them. In addition, the probability of adding (dropping) a layer is very pos- itively (negatively) correlated with value added. We then explore the changes in the wages and number of employees that accompany expansions in layers, output, or markets (by becoming exporters). The empirical results indicate that reorganization, through changes in layers, is key to understand how \ldots rms expand and contract. For example, we \ldots nd that \ldots rms that expand substantially add layers and pay lower average wages in all pre-existing layers. In contrast, \ldots rms that expand little and do not reorganize pay higher average wages in all pre-existing layers.},

@unpublished{Davis2012a,
abstract = {This paper is the first to study vacancies, hires, and vacancy yields at the establishment level in the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, a large sample of U.S. employers. To interpret the data, we develop a simple model that identifies the flow of new vacancies and the job-filling rate for vacant positions. The fill rate moves counter to aggregate employment but rises steeply with employer growth rates in the cross section. It falls with employer size, rises with worker turnover rates, and varies by a factor of four across major industry groups. We also develop evidence that the employer-level hiring technology exhibits mild increasing returns in vacancies, and that employers rely heavily on other instruments, in addition to vacancies, as they vary hires. Building from our evidence and a generalized matching function, we construct a new index of recruiting intensity (per vacancy). Recruiting intensity partly explains the recent breakdown in the standard matching function, delivers a better-fitting empirical Beveridge Curve, and accounts for a large share of fluctuations in aggregate hires. Our evidence and analysis provide useful inputs for assessing, developing and calibrating theoretical models of search, matching and hiring in the labor market.},

This research approach, which we term insider econometrics, addresses these questions by combining insights from industry insiders with rigorous econometric tests about the adoption and productivity effects of new management practices using rich industry-specific data. Understanding the selectivity in the adoption and coverage of different management practices within a single industry is central to this empirical research methodology. The paper considers a number of studies to illustrate persuasive features of insider econometric research and summarizes a number of themes emerging from this line of research.},

abstract = {In this paper, we use a linked employer-employee database from Brazil to examine the impact of trade reform on the wages of workers employed at heterogeneous firms. Our analysis of data at the firm level confirms earlier findings of a differential positive effect of trade liberalization on average wages at exporting firms relative to non-exporting firms. However, the analysis of average firm-level wages is incomplete along several dimensions. First, it cannot fully account for the impact of a change in trade barriers on workforce composition, especially in terms of unobservable (time-invariant) worker characteristics (innate ability) and any additional productivity that results from employment in a specific firm (match-specific ability). Furthermore, the firm-level analysis is undertaken under the assumption that the assignment of workers to firms is random. This ignores the sorting of workers into firms and leads to a bias in estimates of the differential impact of trade on average wages at exporting firms relative to non-exporting firms. Using detailed information on worker and firm characteristics to control for compositional effects and allowing for the endogenous assignment of workers to firms due to time-invariant firm-worker match-specific productivity effects, we find an insignificant differential effect of trade openness on wages at exporting firms relative to domestic firms. We also show that workforce composition post-liberalization improves systematically in exporting firms in terms of the combination of innate worker ability and the quality of the worker-firm matches. Our findings confirm the importance of labor market matching mechanisms in determining the effects of trade policy changes on wages.},

In order to control for unobserved worker differences, we examine both foreign acquisitions and divestments and worker mobility, including the joint estimation of firm and worker fixed effects. We find that changes in ownership do not tend to affect wages significantly, a result that holds both at the worker- and firm-levels. However, divestments are related to large job cuts, unlike acquisitions. On the other hand, movers from foreign to domestic firms take larger wage cuts than movers from domestic to foreign firms. Moreover, on average, the fixed effects of foreign firms are considerably larger than those of domestic firms, while worker selection effects are relatively small.},

Depending on definition, employee spinoffs account for between one-sixth and one-third of the new firms in Brazil’s private sector during this period. Regardless of definition, size at entry is larger for employee spinoffs than for new firms without parents but smaller than for diversification ven- tures of existing firms. Similarly, survival rates for employee spinoffs are higher than for new firms without parents and comparable to those for diversification ventures of existing firms.

Wage structures within and between firms change over this time due to changes in macroeconomic conditions and changes in wage bargaining norms. By the end of the period, wages are less egalitarian. Also, turnover is notably higher, which probably reflects increasing decentralization of bargaining and other changes in the labor market.},

The average structural returns to seniority are essentially zero, but this result masks enormous heterogeneity with positive seniority returns found in low starting-wage firms.

We place HRM more generally within the literature on management practices and productivity. We start with some facts on levels and trends of both HRM and productivity and the main economic theories of HRM. We look at some of the determinants of HRM--risk, competition, ownership and regulation. The largest section analyzes the impact of HRM on productivity emphasizing issues of methodology, data and results (from micro-econometric studies).

It also shows that the divergence of establishment earnings occurred within and across industries and was associated with increased variance of revenues per worker. Our results direct attention to the fundamental role of establishment-level pay setting and economic adjustments in earnings inequality.},

However, thus far no conclusive population-level tests of the complementary joint adoption of management practices have been conducted. Using unique detailed data on internal organization, occupational composition, and firm performance for a nationally representative sample of firms in the Canadian economy, we exploit regional variation in income tax progression as an instrument for the adoption of performance pay. We find systematic evidence for the complementarity of performance pay and decentralization of decision-making from principals to employees. Furthermore, in response to the adoption of performance pay, we find a concentration of decision-making at the level of managerial employees, as opposed to a general movement towards more decentralization throughout the organization. Finally, we find that adoption of performance pay is related to other types of organizational restructuring, such as greater use of outsourcing, Total Quality Management, re-engineering, and a reduction in the number of layers in the hierarchy.},

@article{Topel1992,
abstract = {Using longitudinal data, we study the processes of job mobility and wage growth among young men. During the first ten years in the labor market, a typical worker will hold seven jobs, about two thirds of his career total. The evolution of wages plays a key role in this transition to stable employment: wage gains at job changes account for at least a third of early-career wage growth, and the wage is the key determinant ofjob changing decisions among young workers. Job changing is a critical component of workers' movement toward the stable employment relations of mature careers. The wastefulness of this "try and try again" process of advancing to a better position is self-evident. The worker does not know in detail the nature of the job which he is obtaining nor does he know his own capacities. Nevertheless it is the principal method by which workers at the present time improve their condition on their own initiative [Slichter, 1919, p. 218].},

In addition, these firms prefer to hire employees with little experience in other firms and young men instead of young women. These findings imply at least two things: first, that establishments with internal labor markets use deferred payment as an incentive and give positions requir- ing long tenure to internal candidates and second, that such establishments offer fewer opportunities for unemployed or establishment switchers as well as young females and those with long previous experience in other firms.},

This paper describes the development of an expanded survey tool based on the existing World
Management Survey (WMS) instrument, but tailored to research in the public sector of developing
countries (Development WMS). We collected detailed data from pilots in India and Mexico using
face-to-face interviews in settings where weak management practices prevail and observe more variation
in the left tail of the distribution. Using this data, we present a brief discussion of the type
of data that can be collected and explored with the expanded tool, including three new processes
used to systematically measure the strength of each management area in the WMS: (1) process
implementation, (2) process usage, (3) process monitoring.}

  abstract = {Firms account for a substantial share of earnings inequality. Although the standard explanation
for why is that search frictions support an equilibrium with rents, this paper finds that
compensating differentials are at least as important. To reach this finding, this paper develops a
structural search model and estimates it on U.S. administrative data with 1.5 million firms and
100 million workers. The model analyzes the revealed preference information contained in how
workers move between firms. Compensating differentials are revealed when workers systematically
move to lower-paying firms, while rents are revealed when workers systematically move
to higher-paying firms. With the number of parameters proportional to the number of firms
(1.5 million), standard estimation approaches are infeasible. The paper develops an estimation
approach that is feasible for data on this scale. The approach uses tools from numerical linear
algebra to measure central tendency of worker flows, which is closely related to the ranking of
firms revealed by workers' choices.}
