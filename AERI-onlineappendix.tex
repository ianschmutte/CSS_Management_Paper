\subsection{Data Description}
We describe our three distinct data sources here as well as the details associated with linking them together. First, we describe the matched employer-employee data from \ac{RAIS}. Second, we describe our data on management practices from the \ac{WMS}. Third, we describe our data on firm output and non-labor inputs from the \ac{PIA}. Finally, we describe our the linked datasets used in our analysis.
